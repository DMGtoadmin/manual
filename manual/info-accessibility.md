The DMG workshop and office space is situated on the 3rd floor of the Toronto Media Arts Centre, a 30,000 sq. ft. facility for arts nonprofits offering public event and exhibition spaces and offices.

The building entrance door is _not_ automatic. It pushes inward.

All washrooms at TMAC are all-gender. There are 2 accessible stalls in the multi-stall washroom. There is no door to the multi-stall washroom. There are also single-person washrooms on the 1st floor and the second floor. These single-person washrooms do not have powered doors.

There is an elevator to the 3nd floor. There are two doors between the elevator and the DMG classroom. Both are 48" wide and are propped open at all times.

We ask attendees to avoid wearing perfume or cologne.

Snacks, water, coffee and tea are provided at all events. Please let us know if you have any food restrictions or allergies.

Seating is arranged classroom style, two people per table, for workshops. Chairs are wheeled. The tables are wheeled and easy for a coordinator to move. There is room for wheelchairs and mobility devices at all events.

There is a separate quiet room with a privacy curtain, which you may use in any way you need, including to pray, nap, nurse or take a sensory/rest break.
