# Platforms we use

For now, most of our online events will be held over Zoom or Google Hangouts Meet. We've been using Zoom for the last couple of years for streaming workshops and classes. We're sensitive to privacy and security issues with this platform and are actively seeking open-source and free alternatives, including building our own.

## Safety

Anything you say or do in a Zoom meeting – from video to audio to the chat – could be recorded. Those recordings can then be shared with third parties who weren’t in the original meeting. This is a violation of our [code of conduct](/manual/code-of-conduct/) and we will remind all attendees to refrain from this behavior, which we consider harassing.

To prevent "Zoom bombing" we use waiting rooms and password protection on all event meetings hosted on Zoom. Should an event be targeted, our protocol is to end the meeting immediately, and start a new one. A link and password will be emailed to all attendees right away.

## Logistics

Please arrive a few minutes in advance of the start time so that we can start on time. Some sessions have a waiting room – you'll be grant access momentarily.

### Audio

All events will start with all attendees set to mute to keep ambient sound down as the host begins the event. Depending on the format of the event, you may be able to unmute yourself to speak or ask a question at any time.

### Video

You can join any event with your video turned off, or turn it off at any time during the event.

### Name

We encourage attendees to set their display name to the name you'd ask someone to call you at an in-person event, and to add your pronouns if you wish. Our policy is to default to gender neutral pronouns in case we don't know yours.

### Chat

Please join the Slack channel for the event for ongoing conversation, and feel free to use the built-in chat in the meeting tool for questions and introductions during the event.

### Breakout Rooms

Some events will split up large groups for smaller conversations. The host will assign you to a room automatically and bring everyone back together once the breakout portion is done. The host will let everyone know the format of the breakout, but generally, do not feel obligated to chat with others in your group. Take it as a moment for a bio break if you need to!

### Accessibility needs

We want to create a fully accessible space online for all of our community members. If you require captioning, sign-language interpretation, or another accommodation, please [contact us](mailto:events@dmg.to) a week before your class or event. We are working towards being able to offer captioning by default at all of our online workshops.
