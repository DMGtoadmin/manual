All communications within DMG will support the mission, vision, values and goals of the Board.

The Board will:

- Develop a communications plan which identifies who the Board communicates with, what is communicated, when communication activities occur (e.g., press releases), and how communications are delivered
- Establish communication links with the stakeholders and communities we serve, local governing bodies, arts organizations, ministries and funders
- Use communication strategies which are open and honest, responsive, informed and clear
