The DMG workshop and office space is situated within the Toronto Media Arts Centre, a facility for nonprofits offering public event and exhibition spaces and offices for its member groups.

[Information about the accessibility of the TMAC facility](https://toronto-media-arts-centre.gitbook.io/procedure-manual/policies/accessibility), including washrooms.

_DMG is on the 3rd floor of the building._ There is an elevator just inside the main entrance of TMAC that you can take to the 3rd floor. There are two doors between the elevator and the DMG classroom. Both are 48" wide and easily accommodate power wheelchairs. Neither are powered, but both are propped open for events (and most other times as well).

The workshop space itself is barrier-free. Furnishings are wheeled and easily rearranged to accommodate different mobility device and space needs.

The workshop space is scent-free.
