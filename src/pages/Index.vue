        <strong>DMG is for people who belong to gender identity groups that are systemically marginalized in tech and game spaces. We center genderqueer, nonbinary, femme people, Two Spirit people, and trans and cis women.</strong>
      </div>

      <p>We strive to prioritize the experiences of Black, Indigenous, racialized and people of color, and give up space as part of our work towards redressing dispossession, oppression, settler colonialism and the living legacy of racism. We expect all of our members to do the same.</p>

      <p>If this does not describe you, that doesn't mean you aren't welcome here! It just means that our time, effort, attention, and programming revolves around needs and interests that might not match your own. We hope you'll join as a friend, and look for ways your skills and experience can support our mission and our membership.</p>

      <p>We acknowledge the work of creating a safer, more equitable space is work that will never be complete, and that we're not perfect. The terms we use to describe our experience are always changing, and we are always listening and learning. We are eager to maintain and defend the inclusivity of this community.</p>
